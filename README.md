Responsive grid with two easy break points, 1000 and 600. It looks good on mobile.
The approach to adjust the media queries rules at any break point is good but requires a lot of hindsight, this one was pretty easy since it simply adjusts the grid layout but something that involves an entire page to be visible and navigable on mobile might require some elements to be hidden and some clear buttons for navigations to be more visible.

Also, I should start adding a gif to the readme.md just to show the content right away
